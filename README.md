# üõí RFM Analysis (Customer Segmentation)

This project implements **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis to segment customers and identify opportunities for targeted marketing campaigns. The goal is to understand customer behavior, optimize engagement strategies, and improve **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** and **retention** in a **global retail/e-commerce** context.

## üìÑ Overview

**RFM Analysis** is a powerful customer segmentation technique that classifies customers based on:
- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase.
- **Frequency**: How often they make purchases.
- **Monetary**: How much money they spend.

By analyzing these three metrics, businesses can:
- Identify **high-value customers**
- Design **targeted marketing campaigns**
- Increase **customer retention and loyalty**

This project applies RFM and **cohort analysis** to uncover actionable insights about customer behavior, retention trends, and acquisition strategies.
